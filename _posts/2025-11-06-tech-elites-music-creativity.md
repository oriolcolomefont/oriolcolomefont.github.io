Art and culture emerge from the complexities of the human experience.  I believe we must promote and protect them, because no one —absolutely no one — from the tech elite will lift a finger for it: AI is marketed as empowering and democratizing creativity, yet this rhetoric can mask underlying market control and stimulate a false consciousness. The entertainment industry is undergoing a significant transformation driven by advances in artificial intelligence, which presents fundamental challenges to human culture and creativity. Tech elites and VC-backed initiatives are aggressively pushing this narrative into the industry, framing "AI"—that omnipotent, omnipresent, all-seeing big brother algorithm with more computing power than curiosity, equal parts digital oracle and algorithmic helicopter parent—as an inevitable and beneficial force.

Unlike AI’s ability to replicate and optimize processes, human beings possess a unique capacity for symbolism, allowing us to communicate and construct shared meanings that define our cultural identity. However, as AI increasingly plays a role in content creation and ideation, there is a growing concern that it may dilute human artistic expression.

One key concern is the evolving relationship between AI and creative thought. As automated processes take over traditionally human-led domains, we risk shifting creativity into a digital infosphere where AI-driven systems manage and control symbolic content. Without thoughtful governance, this shift could challenge the very development of human intelligence.

Symbolic culture reflects our shared identity and is the foundation of human dignity. The unique, irreplaceable essence of artistic and intellectual creation must be safeguarded. The unpredictability, imperfection, and organic evolution of creativity make cultural production truly valuable. If AI merely replaces human creativity, rather than enhancing it, we risk losing the richness and depth that define artistic expression.

The responsible development of AI must focus on augmenting, not substituting, human creativity. This requires a deliberate approach to align AI with cultural and artistic objectives. Without such a framework, we risk the erosion of creative communities and the broader cultural ecosystem, as economic and efficiency-driven incentives often fail to prioritize the preservation of artistic and intellectual values. These incentives are largely shaped by tech elites and VC-backed companies that prioritize market control and scalability over cultural preservation.

Don't get me wrong: I am an optimist, and I believe the current momentum in differentiable programming can be a force for good. My coding journey has soared as it has been supercharged by LLM-powered tools and agentic assistants. However, there is no single correct line of thought that should be followed—least of all the opportunistic initiatives that seek to capitalize on this momentum without genuine commitment to cultural and artistic values. I believe that "no control, no revolution", as we believe that fine-grained interactivity is the only way forward.

Addressing this challenge requires more than principles and declarations—it demands action: governmental organizations should play a central role in ensuring that AI does not monopolize cultural capital for purely technological or commercial interests. This is especially critical as tech elites and VC-backed initiatives continue to enforce their vision of AI-driven creativity into the industry. Safeguarding public access to art and cultural heritage must be a global priority, ensuring that innovation remains a force for creative empowerment rather than displacement. 

By portraying the so-called "AI breakthrough" as a friendly, inevitable partner in music's evolution, companies shape how communities discuss creativity, even as users still reclaim agency. This narrative is systematically enforced by tech elites and VC-backed initiatives that have the resources and platform to dominate industry discourse. By protecting the complexities of the human experience, we can create a future where human and artificial intelligence coexist in a way that enriches rather than diminishes cultural expression: no technological convenience should ever outweigh all the humanity, stories, and history being stripped away from our lives to make things faster or cheaper — we risk forgetting who we are.

This means building and shipping with human meaning in mind, not just efficiency. Effort, seams, and time are not inherently bad; they gain value when infused with intention and purpose. In human-centered design, the goal shouldn't be to eliminate effort, but to transform it into something meaningful. We should avoid defaulting to effortlessness, seamlessness, or productivity as design objectives. Instead, we should ask ourselves: what meaningful experience does this enable? The difference between saving time and depriving someone of a fulfilling experience lies in how we define meaning, not the speed or smoothness of the product.
