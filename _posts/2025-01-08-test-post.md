## The Journey to a Modern Web Presence

In today's digital landscape, having a strong online presence isn't just nice to have—it's essential. Whether you're job hunting, building a personal brand, or showcasing your work, your website is often the first impression people have of you.

After working in music technology for over a decade, I finally took the time to build a proper personal website that reflects both my technical skills and my approach to problem-solving.

## Why Jekyll + GitHub Pages?

### The Static Site Renaissance

Static site generators have made a huge comeback, and for good reason:

- **Performance**: No database queries, no server-side rendering. Just fast, pre-built HTML.
- **Security**: With no backend, there's significantly less attack surface.
- **Cost**: GitHub Pages offers free hosting with custom domains.
- **Simplicity**: Focus on content, not infrastructure.

Jekyll, being natively supported by GitHub Pages, was the natural choice. It offers:

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugins
- Liquid templating for dynamic content generation
- Markdown-first content management
- Built-in blog support with collections

## Design Philosophy

### Less is More

I opted for a minimalist design inspired by modern SaaS websites like Linear and Vercel. The key principles:

1. **Whitespace**: Let content breathe
2. **Typography**: System fonts for instant loading
3. **Color**: A simple primary palette with strategic accents
4. **Motion**: Subtle animations that enhance UX without distraction

### Accessibility First

- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Reduced motion preferences respected
- High contrast ratios

## Technical Decisions

### Tailwind CSS Build Pipeline

Initially, I considered using Tailwind via CDN for convenience. However, this approach has significant drawbacks:

- **Bundle size**: CDN version includes all utilities (~3MB)
- **Performance**: Slower initial load times
- **CSP issues**: Requires unsafe-inline for styles

The solution: A proper Tailwind build pipeline with PurgeCSS, reducing the final CSS to under 20KB.

### Component Architecture

Jekyll's include system allows for component-based development:

```liquid
{% include project-card.html 
   title=item.title 
   description=item.description 
   tech_stack=item.tech_stack %}
```

This keeps code DRY and maintainable, similar to modern component frameworks but without the JavaScript overhead.

## Blog Features

### Going Beyond the Basics

A blog isn't just about publishing posts. It's about discoverability and user experience:

- **Search**: Client-side search for instant results
- **Tags & Categories**: Multiple taxonomies for organization
- **Related Posts**: Keep readers engaged
- **Table of Contents**: Navigate long posts easily
- **Reading Time**: Set expectations upfront

## Performance Optimization

### The Numbers

Lighthouse scores are a good proxy for overall site quality:

- **Performance**: 95+
- **Accessibility**: 100
- **Best Practices**: 95+
- **SEO**: 100

### How We Got There

1. **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading, responsive images, WebP format
2. **CSS**: Purged Tailwind build, critical CSS inlined
3. **Fonts**: System font stack (no external requests)
4. **JavaScript**: Minimal, deferred loading
5. **Caching**: Proper cache headers via GitHub Pages

## Content Management

### Writing Workflow

The beauty of a static site is the simple writing workflow:

1. Create Markdown file in `_posts/`
2. Write content with frontmatter metadata
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

No CMS login, no database migrations, no complex deployment pipelines.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

- **Static-first approach**: Fast, secure, simple
- **Component-based includes**: Maintainable code
- **Data files for structured content**: Easy to update
- **Automated deployments**: Push to deploy is liberating

### What I'd Do Differently

- **Earlier Tailwind setup**: Should have started with proper build process
- **More test posts**: Need more content to fully test blog features
- **Analytics setup**: Should integrate from day one
- **Dark mode**: Users expect it now

## The Road Ahead

Building a website isn't a one-time project—it's an evolving platform. Future plans:

- More blog content on music technology and MIR
- Case studies for major projects
- Interactive demos and visualizations
- Newsletter integration
- Comments system

## Conclusion

Building a modern personal website doesn't require complex frameworks or expensive hosting. With Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages, you can create a fast, beautiful, and maintainable site that truly represents you.

The key is focusing on content, performance, and user experience rather than unnecessary complexity. Sometimes the old ways—static HTML, progressive enhancement, semantic markup—are still the best ways.
