## The Journey to a Modern Web Presence

A strong digital presence is no longer optional—it's foundational. Whether you're aiming to advance your career, build a brand, or simply showcase your work, your website is now the first touchpoint for most people.

After years in music technology, I finally created a personal website that not only showcases my skills but is maintainable, accessible, and performant.

## Why Jekyll + GitHub Pages?

### Embracing Static Generation

Static site generators like Jekyll have become essential for modern, lightweight websites:

- **Performance**: Instant load from pre-rendered HTML—no database, no lag.
- **Security**: With no backend logic exposed, security risks are minimal.
- **Cost**: GitHub Pages provides free, reliable hosting, including custom domains.
- **Simplicity**: The infrastructure is minimal—just focus on your content.

Jekyll, which powers GitHub Pages out of the box, was my choice for several reasons:

- Mature plugin ecosystem
- Liquid templating for flexible layouts
- Markdown for natural content writing
- Native support for posts, collections, and data-driven pages

## Design Philosophy

### Less, but Better

I leaned into a minimalist, modern SaaS-inspired style (think: Linear, Vercel). Key tenets:

1. **Whitespace**: Let content breathe.
2. **Typography**: Rely on system fonts for speed—no webfont lag.
3. **Color**: Keep things neutral, with modest accents to highlight important elements.
4. **Motion**: Use animation sparingly, only to improve clarity or focus.

### Accessibility Is Non-Negotiable

- Semantic, standards-based HTML everywhere
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigability for all UI
- Respects user motion preferences (reduced motion)
- Meets high contrast ratios for legibility

## Technical Approach

### Tailwind CSS: From CDN to Purged Builds

Initially, I explored using Tailwind via CDN, but that quickly proved inefficient:

- **Massive bundle**: Unused utilities ballooned CSS sizes (~3MB unminified)
- **Sluggish loads**: Longer time-to-interactive
- **Security (CSP)**: Requires `unsafe-inline`, which is best avoided

**Current Status:**  
I've adopted a proper Tailwind build pipeline with PurgeCSS. Now, unused styles are stripped at build time—measuring in under 20KB for the entire site.

### Modular with Jekyll Includes

Componentization is critical for maintainability. Jekyll's include tag makes it easy:

```liquid
&#123;% include project-card.html 
   title=item.title 
   description=item.description 
   tech_stack=item.tech_stack %&#125;
```

Instead of copy-pasting markup, reusable components now drive the site—much like React/Vue, but without a JS runtime cost.

## Blog Features

### Elevating User Experience

A blog today should be more than a reverse-chronological list. I've built:

- **Client-side search** for near-instant results
- **Tags and categories** for real information architecture
- **Related posts** to increase engagement
- **Dynamic Table of Contents** for long-form posts (see sidebar on desktop)
- **Estimated reading time** auto-generated per post

These features are powered via a combination of Liquid templates, includes, data files, and light JavaScript.

## Performance Optimization

### Current Lighthouse Scores

Continuous focus on performance pays off:

- **Performance**: 95+
- **Accessibility**: 100
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 100

*(You can check actual numbers in the footer or with Chrome DevTools Lighthouse)*

### Behind the Scenes

1. **Images**: All images use `loading="lazy"`, WebP where possible, and responsive `srcset`.
2. **CSS**: Fully-purged Tailwind, with critical CSS inlined for perceived speed.
3. **Fonts**: No external webfonts—the system stack ensures speed and privacy.
4. **JavaScript**: Minimal, deferred, only for UX extras like ToC and search.
5. **Caching**: Relying on GitHub Pages' built-in static caching.

## Content Management

### The Markdown Publishing Flow

Publishing content is now as simple as:

1. Create a Markdown file in `_posts/`
2. Fill in frontmatter (title, date, tags, etc.)
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. GitHub Actions builds and deploys everything automatically

There’s no CMS, no database, and near-zero overhead for publishing or updating content.

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well

- **Static-first**: Ultra-fast and secure
- **Includes/components**: Code stays dry and easy to manage
- **YAML/JSON data files**: One place to update structured data (like music projects)
- **"Push-to-deploy"**: Each update is visible to the world in minutes

### What I’d Change Next Time

- **Start Tailwind build pipeline from day one** to avoid future code churn
- **Create more demo/test content** to better stress-test blog and category features
- **Analytics integration**: Should have been set up at launch, not as an afterthought
- **Dark mode**: It's a user expectation now, and already implemented site-wide via Tailwind's dark mode utilities

## Looking Forward

My site will keep evolving. Planned improvements:

- More deep-dives and case studies on music tech and MIR
- Dedicated project pages and interactive demos
- Newsletter (see footer to sign up)
- Commenting via third-party (privacy-safe) integrations

## Conclusion

Modern personal websites don’t need complex stacks or paid hosting. With Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages you get a performant, scalable site—while retaining full control over your content and tech.

By focusing on accessibility, performance, and clarity, the site offers a better user experience than most all-in-one solutions or heavy JS frameworks.
