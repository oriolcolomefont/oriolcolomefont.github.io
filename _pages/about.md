                    Hi! Oriol, the human, here. I mean that no LLMs were harmed in the making of this content.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm a music tech generalist with over a decade of experience across the music industry and its wiggly-air-multi-modal-cognitive-phenomenon we call MUSIC. I thrive at the intersection of artistry, technology, and strategy.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Currently, as <strong>Growth Lead & Product Owner at My Sheet Music Transcriptions</strong>, I lead research and product development, leveraging open-source technology and the right talent to drive innovation. Recently, I've been hiring for several roles on my team—spanning from full-stack developers to musicologists. As a hiring manager, I've come to value thoughtful, handwritten letters over those generated by LLMs. Qualifications and experience matter, but in the end, soft skills and genuine intent speak louder.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    While my formal education is music-based, my career has evolved into the music tech space, where I've worked with developers and musicologists alike, built teams, and driven business growth by connecting creative, technical, and product domains.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The value I bring is not only in building the right solutions but also in deeply understanding the craft we aim to empower: music itself—the creative process, the rawness, and the intent behind every note. My focus is on <em>augmenting the artist's expression</em> and removing the friction of mundane tasks, rather than replacing artistry with sterile efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cutting to the chase: I bring hands-on music knowledge, MIR-based software skills, and product thinking to every challenge. I've navigated nearly every stage of the music production pipeline, led and developed teams, and worked across creative, business, and tech roles. This unique mix allows me to connect artistic needs with strategic business decisions and technical execution.

                        <strong>On AI, technology, and cultural responsibility:</strong> I stand by the ideas expressed in my longform piece on music, technology, and the future of creativity.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        As automation and so-called "AI" gain ground in creative fields, we must be vigilant in protecting the irreplaceable essence of human artistic expression. I'm committed to advocating for technology that <strong>augments</strong> (not replaces) creativity, and for keeping human meaning, intention, symbolism, and shared culture at the center of all technical advancements. Effort and meaningful experience matter more than convenience. The pursuit of seamlessness and efficiency can, if unchecked, undermine the richness of our culture and creativity.
