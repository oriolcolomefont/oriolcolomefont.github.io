                    Hi! Oriol, the human, here. I mean that no LLMs were harmed in the making of this letter.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Recently, in my current role as Growth Lead & Product Owner at My Sheet Music Transcriptions, I've been hiring for several roles on my team—spanning from full-stack developers to musicologists. As a hiring manager, I came to value thoughtful, handwritten letters over those generated by LLMs. Qualifications and experience matter, but in the end, soft skills and genuine intent speak louder.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I'm Oriol—a music tech generalist with over a decade of experience across the music industry and its wiggly-air-multi-modal-cognitive-phenomenon we call MUSIC. I thrive at the intersection of artistry, technology, and strategy. While my formal education is music-based, my career has evolved into the music tech space, where I've worked with developers and musicologists alike, built teams, and driven business growth by connecting creative, technical, and product domains.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At My Sheet Music Transcriptions, I'm currently leading research and product development, leveraging open-source technology and the right talent to drive innovation. The value I bring is not only in building the right solutions but also in deeply understanding the craft we aim to empower: music itself—the creative process, the rawness, and the intent behind every note. My focus is on augmenting the artist's expression and removing the friction of mundane tasks, rather than replacing artistry with sterile efficiency.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Cutting to the chase: I bring hands-on music knowledge, MIR-based software skills, and product thinking to every challenge. I've navigated nearly every stage of the music production pipeline, led and developed teams, and worked across creative, business, and tech roles. This unique mix allows me to connect artistic needs with strategic business decisions and technical execution.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I might need to apologize in advance for my non-orthodox cover letter; however, I believe it reflects my approach—curious, interdisciplinary, and unapologetically focused on meaningful work.
                </p>
