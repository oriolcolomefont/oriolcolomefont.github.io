                    I'm Oriolâ€”a music tech generalist with over a decade of experience across the music industry and its wiggly-air-multi-modal-cognitive-phenomenon we call MUSIC.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Currently, I'm leading innovation at My Sheet Music Transcriptions. I've worked with full-stack devs and musicologists alike, built cross-functional teams, and driven business growth by bridging creative, technical, and strategic domains.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I understand music from both the artistic and technical perspectives, and I thrive at the intersection of innovation and artistry. I'm motivated by meaningful challenges and bring a mix of hands-on music knowledge, MIR-based software skills, and product thinking to any mission.
